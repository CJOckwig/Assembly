# Assembly
This is a repository of asm files which were completed in Assembly Language (CSC314) taught through South Dakota State University. (Fall 2021)

All testing was tested through DosBox x86

Listed is the linked programs and their functions
### OCKWIGA2
This is an introductory assignment designed to show the rudimentary funtctions of the 3 segment code model
The goal was to print you name as well as your favorite artist or music.
The key aspects were loading registers, creating designated data segmets (Specifically MessageName and MessageMusic) and loading them from memory

### OCKWIGA3
This program collects the date and time from the operating System and loads the month into the DH register, Day into the DL register, Year into the CX register, and day of the week into the AL register.

This program also used linking libraries to call a function.

### OCKWIGA4
Description: This program will convert a temperature given in celsius and 
convert it to farenheit using the formula F = (9/5)C+32

### OCKWIGA6
This program moves a character input by the user and moves it across the screen between 1 adn 3 times.

### OCKWIGA7
This program finds the greatest common denominator between two user chosen numbers using the formula:
while (M<>N)
  if(N > M)
  N = N - M
  else
  M = M - N
### OCKWIGA8
This will take a user given amount of integers which will make a string of #'s relative to the numbers input by the user.
